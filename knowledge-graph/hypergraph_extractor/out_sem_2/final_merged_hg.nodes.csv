Patterns and Use of Hepatic Enzymes in Practice The liver enzyme profile should always be assessed in conjunction with a thorough history and clinical examination.

For example, does an overweight diabetic who enjoys a few glasses of wine at the weekend have alcoholic or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease? In such circumstances the absolute liver enzyme levels and ratios may point the clinician in the right direction. Furthermore, the pattern of enzymes will assist, not only with differentiating between cholestasis and hepatitis, but will aid diagnosis when there is a mixed picture. ",1.0,0.0
