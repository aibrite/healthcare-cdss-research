Sure! Hereâ€™s a schema generation prompt tailored for an HR Knowledge Graph (HRKG):

---

**Prompt:**

You are an expert in knowledge graph schema design for Human Resources (HR) domains. Given the following HR-related concepts, entities, and relationships, generate a concise, extensible schema for an HR Knowledge Graph (HRKG). The schema should include:

- **Entity Types** (with brief descriptions)
- **Key Properties** for each entity type (with data types)
- **Relationship Types** (with direction and brief descriptions)
- **Example Triples** (subject-predicate-object) illustrating the schema

**HR Concepts to Cover:**
- Employee
- Department
- Position/Job Title
- Skill
- Project
- Manager
- Performance Review
- Training/Course
- Certification

**Instructions:**
- Use clear, consistent naming conventions.
- Specify data types (e.g., string, date, integer, boolean, URI).
- Indicate cardinality where relevant (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many).
- Make the schema extensible for future HR concepts.
- Present the schema in a structured, readable format (e.g., Markdown tables or bullet points).

**Example Output Format:**

### Entity Types

| Entity Type      | Description                          | Key Properties (Data Type)                |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Employee         | An individual employed by the org    | employee_id (string), name (string), hire_date (date), email (string), ... |
| Department       | Organizational unit                  | dept_id (string), name (string), ...      |
| ...              | ...                                  | ...                                       |

### Relationship Types

| Relationship         | From Entity | To Entity   | Description                        | Cardinality      |
|----------------------|-------------|-------------|------------------------------------|------------------|
| works_in             | Employee    | Department  | Employee belongs to a department   | many-to-one      |
| manages              | Manager     | Department  | Manager leads a department         | one-to-one       |
| ...                  | ...         | ...         | ...                                | ...              |

### Example Triples

- (Employee:JohnDoe, works_in, Department:Engineering)
- (Employee:JohnDoe, has_skill, Skill:Python)
- (Employee:JohnDoe, completed, Training:Leadership101)
- (Manager:JaneSmith, manages, Department:Engineering)
