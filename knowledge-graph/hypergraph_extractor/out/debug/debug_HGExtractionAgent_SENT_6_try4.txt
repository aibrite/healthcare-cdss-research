Certainly! Hereâ€™s a schema generation prompt tailored for the "HG" context. If you have a specific domain or data type in mind for "HG," please clarify for further customization. Below is a general-purpose schema generation prompt:

**Schema Generation Prompt for HG**

You are an expert data architect. Your task is to generate a comprehensive and normalized database schema for the following use case:

**Use Case Description:**  
[Insert a detailed description of the "HG" use case here. For example: "HG is a platform for managing horticultural gardens, tracking plant species, garden layouts, maintenance schedules, and user activities."]

**Instructions:**
1. Identify all relevant entities and their relationships.
2. For each entity, specify:
   - Table name
   - Field names and data types
   - Primary and foreign keys
   - Constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE)
   - Indexes if necessary
3. Use clear and consistent naming conventions.
4. Normalize the schema to at least 3NF (Third Normal Form).
5. Present the schema in a readable format (preferably as a set of CREATE TABLE statements in SQL).
6. Optionally, include a brief explanation of the schema design choices.

**Example Output Format:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE gardens (
    garden_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    location VARCHAR(255),
    created_at DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id)
);

-- Add more tables as needed
```

**Please generate the full schema based on the above instructions and the provided use case.**

If you provide the specific "HG" use case or domain, I can further tailor the prompt or generate an example schema for you!
