Sure! Hereâ€™s a template prompt for generating a schema from a text description, tailored for the "HG" (likely "HuggingFace" or "Human-Generated") context. This prompt is designed to instruct an LLM to extract or generate a structured schema (e.g., in JSON Schema, Pydantic, or similar formats) from a natural language description.

**Prompt: Schema Generation from Text Description (HG)**

You are an expert data architect. Given the following text description of a data object, generate a detailed schema in JSON Schema format. The schema should accurately capture all fields, their types, required/optional status, and any constraints or enumerations mentioned or implied in the description. If the description is ambiguous, make reasonable assumptions and document them as comments in the schema.

**Text Description:**
"""
{{Insert the text description of the data object here.}}
"""

**Instructions:**
- Output only the JSON Schema (in JSON format).
- Include comments (using the "description" field in JSON Schema) to explain assumptions or clarify ambiguous fields.
- Use appropriate data types (string, integer, boolean, array, object, etc.).
- Mark required fields as per the description.
- If enumerations or value constraints are mentioned, include them.
- If nested objects or arrays are described, model them appropriately.
- Do not include any explanation outside the schema.

**Example Input:**
"""
A user profile contains a username (string), email address (string, must be a valid email), age (integer, optional), and a list of interests (array of strings).
"""

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "username": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The user's username."
    },
    "email": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "email",
      "description": "The user's email address. Must be a valid email."
    },
    "age": {
      "type": "integer",
      "description": "The user's age. Optional field."
    },
    "interests": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "description": "A list of the user's interests."
    }
  },
  "required": ["username", "email", "interests"]
}
```
